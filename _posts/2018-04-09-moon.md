She is the daisy, all crude lines and crayon, the first-grade boy drew for his mother. She is a crumpled-up letter. She is the reason why the teen-age boy throws the stone at his father’s eye. She lights the red fox’s fur crossing the meadow, a silvery line ghosting bearded grasses. She stalks lovers and murderers. Her appearance and disappearance is a repeated chant, ancient breath of some greater lung. Stone-faced vamp, store-house of whispered confessions. Shrunk thin as a razor cut, or ballooned big as a giant squid’s eye, she returns every night to the sky out of spite, because she loves what she cannot escape.
