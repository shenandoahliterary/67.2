Halo of insane tongues, mortifying mantle, sanguine pearl on a fingertip, God Almighty’s Cow: very unlucky to kill.  A children’s verse once told us so—* * *Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home*— but that was before they invaded by the thousands (or rose from their native soil). Furred windows, the crunch on the basement floor, the crimson glass of them, bullet into the lightbulb, boat of a body floating in the evening wine, wafting in the waves made by the vain scoops of my silver spoon. My enemy, my enemy, I was in a habit: to hold you in my palm, to say a prayer, then to push you aloft, the veins of your inner wings visible in the sun, to seek my heart—*call my true **love from the faithless town.*  But I vacuum up hundreds of you now, millions, alive or not, I don’t discriminate, even though, as I pull the cork on another bottle and the year deepens to the dead season (oaks brandishing their leaves, poison ivy bright as any artery) you coffin my door, bloody my sills, and I hear you rattling (or is that the news turned to low?), red cells pumping, little army in a lightless chamber, restless as sin.
