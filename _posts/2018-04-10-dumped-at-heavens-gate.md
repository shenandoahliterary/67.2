When a hurricane spirals down, spinning like an unhooked tongue shrieking in the wind’s wet mouth, beheading trees and cracking open the sky, pregnant cows in the fields let down their calves. Whether the cause is barometric pressure or the trauma of a bovine nightmare, the legs buckle and the great spasms of the uterine walls begin. All day and into the night, hit by a fury of flying leaves and limbs she labors: a fifteen-hundred- pound bellow nailed to the spot. All the world’s misery concentrated in that heaving flesh, that drenched monolith of quiver and rolling eyes. And if in the wind’s howl and rain, her warm, slick package manages to slip out and live, and she – remembering to turn her head and lick it clean – blinks to find it next morning wobbling on its first legs, that too is Easter.
