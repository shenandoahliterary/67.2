Between the gas and the can my lower leg disappeared in a blue and orange flame. Nothing is more articulate than fire. It moves in slow motion at the speed of light, a ragged language, raw and messy, that leaves a shattered chugging trail of shadows and debris, the charred coals of a formerly living thing. Fire never mutters. It barks with surprise, then shrieks, tears apart the precision of speech, and leaves a soiled scar of broken sentences. Impaled on a spit, clarity returns in a burst. Thirty-five years ago, what hung a flaming necktie round my tender brain, and begged through the spindle of my body for some sudden flash of truth? Fire filled my veins. Poetry pulled me out by the roots.
