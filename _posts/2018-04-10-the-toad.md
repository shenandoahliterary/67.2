Yesterday I found a desiccated toad, sucked out and weightless. Each toe – long, curved, delicate as eyelash. The twin eye sockets, the slit of the mouth, the froggy bend of the back knees flexed to jump. Only the insides were missing. The wet batteries of the body’s workings. The juice. The amazing tongue. Like the princess in a tale, I carried it upstairs. In what hour of the night and by whom was the deed done? The slurp of flesh drained out as if drawn by a straw, leaving a carapace for the sun to mummify on my doorstep. I am waiting for the toad to answer. Shell of a stolen life, empty as a dinner plate, empty as the sky that looked down on the making of this knick-knack, this siphoned-out perfection. Gently, I place the toad on my pillow. Do not laugh. I expect much from the dead. Unlike the princess who never sat waiting in a hospice room, I’ve had practice, kissing the silent, vacant clay – warts and all.
