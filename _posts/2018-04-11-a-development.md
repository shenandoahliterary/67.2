Maybe this will stop her, the cardinal who’s flinging herself at the windowpanes: a row of cobalt bottles on each sill. I thought she had lost her mate, lone widow seeing herself—shadow of scarlet—in the glass, or had eaten something toxic, drunk the new asphalt’s runoff.  But my friends with houses of their own tell me she sees a threat in the glass.  She’s at the kitchen now, frenzied and pecking.  There’s a bloody streak where she thudded and fell back, a slight stain that the fluorescent light brightens to gold.  The mendicant cat from next door lies in wait, paws cocked, by the porch, good soldier, and beyond the yard, it’s true, the woods are disappearing, black walnut trees siphoned out for sale, the cedars knocked to rubble because of their scrubby looks.  The oaks still offer some leaves, but their days are numbered— opportunistic sumacs already occupy the edges of the new lawns with their cheerful for-sale-by-owner signs. My blue warning is nothing so much as a target, and the red bird’s back, backlit by sun, shrieking into the living room. She’s not even enticed by a feeder full of sunflower seed.  She acts like she was here first.  Acts like she owns the damned place.
