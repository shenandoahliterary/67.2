The Death’s Head turned into an angel over time, its crossbones into wings— side-by-side, you see it with this girl. “Here lyes buried the body of Rachel” (her headstone used for a crayon rubbing), the Death’s Head turned into an angel. Her parents hoped death was a brief spell, like sleep, to be followed by awakening— side-by-side, you see it with this girl. She died at twelve—not nearby Samuel who experienced King Philip’s War’s suffering: his Death’s Head later become an angel. I’m a lapsed-Catholic, but believe in symbols. My lifetime? Two kids, five wars (still counting)— side-by-side, you see it with this girl. So this is my Gray’s “Elegy,” this villanelle (different churchyard, while vacationing)— the Death’s Head turned into an angel. Side-by-side, you see it with this girl.
