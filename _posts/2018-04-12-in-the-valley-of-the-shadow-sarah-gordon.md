How she remembers, years after her mother died, that big lake in her childhood, so wide, her father pronounced solemnly, you couldn’t see across. How that first lesson in unfathomable distance stayed with her, the limits of vision, the senseless deep.  Her toe could not touch bottom. How she’d caught on to his little joke and made of herself a containment vessel:  settling heroically behind the wheel, fingering the surgical stitches as she awaited the doctor’s call, breaking bread with the enemy more than once, sifting through the ashes. Hail Mary. Hell. Stepping up to the plate. How now, in her old age, the ball of twine swiftly rolls just out of reach. How the glass falls and breaks, and water, so much water, twice or thrice what the glass could hold, spills everywhere, ruining page and paper and carpet and cloth. How there is no such thing as graceful retrieval, no such thing as unremarkable loss. Houses empty like candy jars, scattering their treasures on the lawn. The hole in the sofa is an open wound, the dingy linen folded to hide the primal stains. How cracked those cups that once ran over, how seamed they are, those broken hearts, now permanently out of stock, discontinued, like letters, land lines, family.  How memory exists without a sound, unvarnished scenes from a silent movie, rapid-fire, endlessly tantalizing. How she clings to that intimate cast of characters, fondly lingering over this one, that one, making alterations, adding color, dialogue, markers, walls.
