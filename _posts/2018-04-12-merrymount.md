Standish sacked Merrymount and drove the heathens out. Not to be outdone, Endicott the iconoclast came for the crumbs, leveling what was left of a maypole on its hill. I remember in darksome Devonshire many a maid in May wound round the bole. We frolicked and sang and crowned the white queen and pranked ourselves up with cowslip and crowfoot. We sported and shot to our hearts’ content, brave boys less intent on prayer than merriment, innocent of our sin, of the very word *pagan*— unlike that boisterous company that called itself merry, rogues their lord Morton like some antichrist suffered to free unto slavery to nature and appetite, bandettos and squaws that knew no laws or limits to their revelry (our holiday lasted but a few blasted days).—Still, when I read of Solomon’s green beds and rafters of fir, I remember.
