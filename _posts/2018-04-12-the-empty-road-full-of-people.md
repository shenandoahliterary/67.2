*Wenatchee, WA * Everything looks right in this photo of the 1910 Fourth of July parade taken from a rooftop near Palouse. Black and white world of hand-lettered windows, men in hats on crowded walks, and power poles striding toward a bright horizon.  Everything except the foreground where townsfolk are not facing the oncoming displays of first-ever automobiles, only the empty road before them. See those splotches across the packed dirt?  That's where the Okanagans and Wenatchis went. First they were there, in vests and feathers, liquid moments riding horses, then the slow swipe of a thumb. He wanted them gone, that photographer, white as I am, ghost bent over negatives in the dark.  In celebration of his independence the tribes had come. What made him want to undo that? What could he not see in their faces, their bodies smeared into oil stains? A hundred years later his failure appears in my old student come back from the arts school, her black hair not vanishing but sliding across her shoulders as she leans from her chair with the mini sally bag she has made.  *Celly bag*, she says, and points to the woven image of the cell phone, her near-smile the same I've seen in her uncle and others of her tribe. Here they are, brought forward by her hands. Here she is, as if years hadn't gone by, asking me to stand beside her as she raises her phone aimed back. *for Carly Feddersen*
