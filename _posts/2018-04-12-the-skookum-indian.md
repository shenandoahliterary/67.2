*since 1921, Wenatchee, WA* Above the Dollar Tree those dark eyes shift side to side all day and all night. Now and then one of them winks. He’s a giant motorized head, this Indian of ours, with a cartoon nose and long dark braids. Above the Dollar Tree those dark eyes shadow us wherever we drive, googly holes welded to a wobbling sky where now and then one of them winks. A grin big as a sunset that won’t die promises a brand of apples long dead beside the Dollar Tree. (Those dark eyes.) We mostly forget, but tourists want pictures of his huge cheeks, red and sweet as Fujis. Now and then one of them winks back. His name means *strong *or* monstrous*. The tilt of his single feather never alters. Above the Dollar Tree those dark eyes. Now and then one of them winks.
