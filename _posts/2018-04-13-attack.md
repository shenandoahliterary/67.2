As if the heart had turned coat and fisted herself into a knot, tightwadding breath, blocking off thought and the light in the kitchen, the road to the daughter’s house just down the way and the whole of the soft, soft morning in May. As if the heart were a weapon formed against you, an enemy at the gate and not the lone runner from the outskirts bent under the weight, the gravity of the word she carried, collapsing at your back door, the body’s crumple the only word she can muster. As if she herself were not breaking. As if she were not your own truest self, there in your kitchen in the morning, nor the open windows of your daughter’s house down the road. As if your heart were not, for you, the whole soft breath of May, and everything else of this world you’ve known along the way.
