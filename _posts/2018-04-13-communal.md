Yesterday afternoon, my wife taught me blueberry plants come with all the parts they need to bear fruit, both male and female. To get one full of berries, though, you need to plant it right next to some blueberries from a different family. The only way they’ll fill with blossoms and fruit is to cross pollinate. Swarms of bees bring the goods from one plant to the next, and the lot grow healthy and prosper. Two plants, a small garden, and enough bees to outlast our dog’s urge to snap them out of the air as they fly from bloom to bloom. Such a simple equation, this. So sensical that togetherness, time, and a little help will fill our bowls to overflowing.
