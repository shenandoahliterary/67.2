But there is no crash or shatter. Only a hush, a slow rousing, the eider ducks’ merest mutterings. Light seeps into the sky as though leaking from unfurled fingers, and here, delivered on an open palm, the bay against the sky a margin of incandescence. One by one, larks vie for most intricate solo. An onshore wind, helping things along, articulates snaking ribbons of tidal current. I, too, almost inexorably, start to move into morning tasks, projects I may not finish before this day’s lingering is extinguished. But how abrupt the radio’s news reminds me that elsewhere on this insistent, revolving planet, one more war lifts its head, awakened or having never slept. In some other place, in its morning’s first scattering light bereft of bird-song and leaf-toss, a village is blasted into rubble, and a soldier, too young to have to know such despair, dodges crosshairs. A short while ago, he shrugged off half a moon. Now he goes down with half a face as all around him, day breaks.
