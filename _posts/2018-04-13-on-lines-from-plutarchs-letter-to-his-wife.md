> . . . if I find your grief exceeds due measure I shall be more greatly distressed than by the misfortune itself.    -- Plutarch Upon learning of Timoxena’s death, unable to write her name until late in his letter, he asked his wife this favor: Do not let your grief exceed due measure. Death is no more than one’s state before birth. There was no grief before our daughter came. Why should we grieve now that she is gone? All that has passed is a two-year life, eight seasons of small delights. Should such a gift be mourned? And a life so brief the soul lacked time to stiffen into a mold she would find difficult to shed. You ask me how one measures pain, how one bottles tides. Dear wife, this is virtue’s test. Let us grieve quietly, together, alone.
