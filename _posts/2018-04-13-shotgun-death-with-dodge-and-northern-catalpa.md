* **-Catalpa speciosa* -March 26, 1951 How long have they idled, motor throttled down, off the two-track, at rest on snow-crust in his ’47 Dodge, its chrome bumper, its yellow fog lamps, facing the catalpa tree, the heater madly whirring against a night gone entirely cold? The man at the wheel is her first husband, the woman who will soon enough be my mother is seated beside his body, hand lifting to her lip-sticked mouth, the air in the Dodge so lit, fully blown of gun-powder, of sloe gin and cotton wadding, a waxy shell ejected, clattering against the right-side dash. She has bruised an ear drum, she says, from the blast of that .12 gauge, hammered flat at close range. This, the shock, her bedlamic shriek, will muddle her thoughts, make it hard to hear the coroner, to understand the parish priest, to weep sincerely, some whisper, until his baffled parents order a marker from the VFW, and drive back to Terre Haute. How did the pump-action shotgun, cut to riot-length, its butt at-rest in the rear foot-well, its coal-blue barrel angled at the driver’s side of the bench seat— go off? Who clicked three shells into the magazine, who racked the pump, and was the safety on? The detectives who rumble out, sirens wailing, from the far-off county seat, who swaddle her in wool blankets, who smoke Luckies and toe them deftly into the snow, who light-up her footprints with flashbulbs and prowl-car spots— they want only sensible geometry and a few hard facts, but she cannot say why her husband placed the shotgun like-so, why they idled, motor lowing, so long into the dark, why his cob-yellow brains and bits of seat-fluff stipple her tight pink sweater and the blown-out windshield, or why, high above them, the wintered seed pods of the catalpa tree—longish, thin, but for where the adamantine seeds swell the pods’ tobacco-brown casings— are splattered with the song-less tongue and silent lips of that long-rumored, half-hearted man.
