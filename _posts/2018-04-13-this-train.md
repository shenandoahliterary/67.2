*This train is bound for glory, this train . . . *comes in the voices of fellowship from the Holiness Refuge Tabernacle on the Hill. Rooted in a road-side gully, a salt-loving wild morning glory has set out bearing crimson flowers. Leaves tremble in the trade wind, all notched like a hoof, or heart, the vine bound for the Great Salt Pond atop a dormant underground volcano. Runaway slaves were drowned there in chains, the pond a ledger in which the master entered profits and losses. Seeds float from the vine to live forever, returning faithfully to gullies and waste ground in spindrift blown from the pond. Itâ€™s the glory this train is bound for.
